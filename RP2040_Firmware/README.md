# Firmware for RP2040 with Klipper

Compiled from Klipper v10. Disconnect the RP2040 from usb, press and hold `Boot` button, connect to usb, stop to press Boot button (it will be mounted as a storage device); open the folder of RP2040 and copy inside the firmware `klipper.uf2`: after the copy, the RP2040 will disconnect automatically and it will be ready. If you can't find RP2040 after disconnect/reconnect, use `klipper_03H.uf2`.
